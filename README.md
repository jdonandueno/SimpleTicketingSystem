# SimpleTicketingSystem

This is a project implementing a basic ticketing system as an example

#Usage

```
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init webpack my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
If port 8080 is already in use on your machine you must change the port number in /config/index.js. Otherwise npm run dev will fail.
